Creating Customer Segments with Arvado

In this project, Udacity partners Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. These datasets are not available to public, so please modify the csv file loaded in the Jupiter notebook for location of dataseet.

I looked at the relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
